# **ML_Pycaret_Pipeline**

This project demonstrates the machine learning pipeline for Regression, Classification, and Clustering using Pycaret 3.0 on Jupyter Notebook. The data used in this project is the "Tips" dataset.

## **Overview**
This project showcases the use of Pycaret 3.0, a low-code machine learning library, to perform Regression, Classification, and Clustering analysis on the `Tips`, `Penguins` and `CreditCard` dataset. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for building and evaluating the machine learning models.

## **Requirements**
To run this project, you need the following:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pycaret 3.0
- Python 3.x

## **Installation**
To install Pycaret 3.0, run the following command:

```bash python
!pip install pycaret
```
## **Dataset**
The `Tips` dataset contains information about the tips given by customers at a restaurant. It includes features such as the total bill, the gender of the customer, whether they smoke or not, etc.

The dataset can be found in the `Data` folder.

## **Usage**
To run the project, open the `ML_Pycaret_Pipeline.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells.

The notebook contains the following sections:

- Data Preparation: This section loads the dataset and performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Regression Analysis: This section builds and evaluates machine learning models for regression analysis using Pycaret 3.0.
- Classification Analysis: This section builds and evaluates machine learning models for classification analysis using Pycaret 3.0.
- Clustering Analysis: This section builds and evaluates machine learning models for clustering analysis using Pycaret 3.0.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the use of Pycaret 3.0 for building and evaluating machine learning models for Regression, Classification, and Clustering analysis. The code and techniques used in this project can be adapted to other datasets and machine learning problems.
